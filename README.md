# blog_project
A blog Project using Django framework, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap and HTML.
In this project I have created a blog website using django framework with the help of a tutorial of udemy. 
A admin can post blog messages go to certain links like github and linkedin, view user comments and also can delete comments. There are some css features to highlight posts also.
